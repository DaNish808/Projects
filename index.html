                            Site incorporates basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript across two pages. The home page was built using the 
                            standard set of HTML tags and displays several simple markups. HTML elements were stylized with a
                            range of CSS properties, including use of the hover pseudoselector and extensive experimentation with 
                            borders and shadows. Site also features a rudementary quiz utilizing the browsers prompt() functions. 
                            The questions are displayed along with the user's answers and score on the following page using rudimentary 
                            DOM manipulations and some dynamic addition of table elements in JavaScript. Javascript is also used
                            in processing the answers to the quiz, bringing functions, variables, arrays, loops, and control-
                            flow elements, random number generation, and simple math operation into play.

                            Three pages. Expands on basic topics covered in the About_Me project and brings in new interactive 
                            functionality with HTML forms and JavaScript events on the sales data page. The sales page heavily
                            utilizes JavaScript objects to generate, store, and manipulate a set of data, which can be infinitely
                            expanded by the user through data input events by the user. The locations page involves 
                            relatively intensive DOM manipulation, toggling between a series of iframe-d Google maps along with 
                            personalized descriptions of each location at the click of a button. Toggling is achieved by element
                            creation and deletion with each new 'page'. On the home page are a pair of simple animations. CSS was
                            developed with emphasis on content fit, and was assisted by a color palette. A developer's navigation 
                            bar has been temporarilyadded to the right side of the screen for convenience.

                            One page. Incorporates local storage, the Chart.js and Canvas libraries, simple animations, data-
                            manipulation, extensive use of object literals and constructors, several event listeners, and heavy 
                            DOM manipulation throughout. Low emphasis on UX. The initial survey is displayed and mediated by
                            event driven DOM methods but may be skipped using the randomly operated auto-complete option in the
                            top right corner. Also on the voting display is an entirely irrelevant animated Canvas.js distraction.
                            It features a variety of toggle-able animation options, but is not yet complete and should be played
                            with caution. When the survey is complete, any running animations are stopped and the HTML content
                            is modified to display the current and past results of the survey in several data formats. All charts
                            are created with Chart.js. Data from each survey are pushed to local storage, and persist on that
                            computer each time the site is loaded. The table design is entirely original CSS and features hover 
                            interactivity.
